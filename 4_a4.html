      <h1>Pseudo element Selector</h1>
      <p>
        Pseudo-element selectors in HTML (used with CSS) allow you to style specific parts of an element 
        without changing the actual HTML content. They are especially useful for adding decorative or functional effects.
         For example, ::before and ::after let you insert content before or after an element. Other pseudo-elements like 
         ::first-letter and ::first-line are used to style only the first letter or the first line of a paragraph. These 
         selectors help enhance the appearance of a webpage with minimal effort.
